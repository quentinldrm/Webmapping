Project overview Webmapping is an interactive web mapping project that provides a clear, browser‑based way to explore geographic information (live demo: https://quentinldrm.github.io/Webmapping/). The emphasis is on simple, effective cartographic display and intuitive interactions: visualizing points of interest, vector layers, and showing related information through popups or tooltips. The project is suitable both as a demonstration tool and as a means to publish and explore geographic datasets.

Data used

Data types: vector files (GeoJSON primarily; CSV converted to GeoJSON when needed), including collections of points, polygons, and linestrings.
Basemaps: online tile services (for example OpenStreetMap or other tile providers) provide contextual background.
Sources: public open data portals, OpenStreetMap extracts, and user-supplied GeoJSON datasets.
Attributes and metadata: each vector feature may include descriptive properties (name, type, description, link) presented in popups for context.
Licensing and attribution: data sources must be attributed and used in accordance with their licenses (e.g., ODbL for OpenStreetMap or dataset-specific licenses from open data portals).
Audience and use cases

Quick visualization and exploration of geographic datasets.
Presenting territorial projects or inventories of geolocated objects.
Teaching and demonstration material for web mapping and geospatial data formats.
